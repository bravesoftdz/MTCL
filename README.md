Multithreaded Component Library for Delphi
==========================================

MTCL is a library started to provide an easy way to build multithreaded visual applications.

It is started with code used internally by ADDIPOS GmbH in the hope that with the help of
other developers a greater library will emerge than if we continued on our own.

We needed not much so far, so at the moment there is only the dialog class itself and 
basic wrappers for a button, an edit and a memo.

To help reaching this goal the library is licensed under he MPL, so it can be used in any
commercial or freeware application without the need to publish the code of the application 
as well. Only changes and additions to this library have to be published.

Todo
----
I'd like to add:
- dynamic creation of the controls at runtime as alternative to the usage of resource
- at least positioning and a few other basic properties
- after this a few new controls as a progressbar
